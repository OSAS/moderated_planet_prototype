<p>It's not a secret that the CentOS project has always been running on <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/Donate#head-2d5ae152a1967f88237a2d61216613e142d42fc1">sponsored infra</a> since the beginning of the journey. While over the years we sometimes lost some "sponsors", we are always happy to see new ones joigning <a href="https://www.centos.org/sponsors">us </a>.Â That's especially true for the infra used to "seed" the CentOS distro and SIGs content to external mirrors, and even more in regions that are less covered.</p>
<p>While we have some nodes in North America and Europe, some other regions are less covered (if not at all). That's why we'd like to say thank you to <a href="https://www.packet.com/">Packet</a> to have recently sponsored some bare-metal nodes that are now members of our <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CreatePublicMirrors">msync</a> network, including (but not limited) to regions like Asia (with one node in Japan !), Europe and America. Welcome !</p>
