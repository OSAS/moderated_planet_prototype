<h1>Highlights of the week</h1>



<h2>Infrastructure &amp; Release Engineering</h2>



<h3>Goal of this Initiative</h3>



<p>The purpose of this team is to take care of day to day business regarding CentOS and Fedora Infrastructure and Fedora release engineering work. It’s responsible for services running in Fedora and CentOS infrastructure and preparing things for the new Fedora release (mirrors, mass branching, new namespaces etc.). The ARC (which is a subset of the team) investigates possible initiatives that CPE might take on.</p>

</li>
<li>Business as usual</li>
</ul>



<h2>CentOS Stream</h2>



<h3>Goal of this Initiative</h3>



<p>his initiative is working on CentOS Stream/Emerging RHEL to make this new distribution a reality. The goal of this initiative is to prepare the ecosystem for the new CentOS Stream.</p>

<h2>CentOS Duffy CI</h2>



<h3>Goal of this Initiative</h3>



<p>Duffy is a system within CentOS CI Infra that allows tenants to provision and access bare metal resources of multiple architectures for the purposes of CI testing.</p>



<p>We need to add the ability to checkout VMs in CentOS CI in Duffy. We have OpenNebula hypervisor available and have started developing playbooks that can be used to create VMs using the OpenNebula API, but due to the current state of how Duffy is deployed, we are blocked with new dev work to add the VM checkout functionality.</p>



<h3>Updates</h3>



<ul>
<li>Set up a boilerplate with a skeleton application</li>
<li>Set up the CI in the repository with tests and coverage</li>
<li>Created a CLI for configuring parameters</li>
<li>Discussed workflows and methods for implementing models</li>
</ul>



<h2>FCOS OpenShift migration</h2>



<h3>Goal of this Initiative</h3>



<p>Move current Fedora CoreOS pipeline from the centos-ci OCP4 cluster to the newly deployed fedora infra OCP4 cluster.</p>



<h3>Updates</h3>



<ul>
<li>Obtaining access on the cluster</li>
<li>Creating playbook to create OpenShift resources</li>
<li>Got the cluster updated and ready</li>
</ul>
