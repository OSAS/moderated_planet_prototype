<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Sorry for the two week gap since my last report, we had a busy time in<br>
the CPE team with the new fedora accounts deployment, our quarterly<br>
planning cycle started for Q2 and Ireland had a bank holiday mid week<br>
which *seemed* like a great idea at the time. Until no-one knew what<br>
day it was for about a week!</p>
<p>So here I am, right at the end of Q1 with the CPE teams final weekly<br>
report for January, February and March... two days early</p>
<p>If you would like to see this report and toggle to the section you are<br>
most interested in, I would suggest visiting this link<br>

team last week when we were deploying the new system. Your help did<br>
not go unnoticed and unappreciated and we could not have done this<br>
work without any of you. You know who you are, and you have my and the<br>
wider teams sincerest thanks and gratitude</p>
<h2>Team Info</h2>
<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>The Community Platform Engineering group, or CPE for short, is the Red<br>
Hat team combining IT and release engineering from Fedora and CentOS.<br>
Our goal is to keep core servers and services running and maintained,<br>
build releases, and other strategic tasks that need more dedicated<br>
time than volunteers can give.</p>
<p>See our wiki page here for more<br>
information: <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cpe/">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cpe/</a></p>
<p>As always, feedback is welcome, and we will continue to look at ways<br>
to improve the delivery and readability of this weekly report.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend!</p>
<p>Aoife</p>
