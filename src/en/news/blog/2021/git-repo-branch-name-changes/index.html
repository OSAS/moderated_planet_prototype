<p>In line with the Fedora vision, we just completed some changes to the git branch names used on src.fedoraproject.org and elsewhere. We removed the “master” branch for those repositories. For rpms and containers, the default branch is now named “rawhide”, with a symref (alias) of “main”. For flatpaks, “stable” is the default/only branch. The fedpkg tool is updated on all supported released to accommodate this change.</p>



<p>For now module repos are unchanged. We are awaiting improvements in the branch/repo requesting tool to allow module owners to request only those specific named branch streams, since “main” and “rawhide” don’t make sense in that context.</p>



<p>For a list of other impacted repositories, see the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/GitRepos-master-to-main">change proposal</a>. Of course, other repos have been migrated by their owners independently. </p>



<p>If you have a repo checked out with the master branch still, you can run:<em> git fetch &amp;&amp; git switch main</em></p>



<p>This work is part of a larger effort across the technology industry to be more inclusive in the language we use. See Rich Bowen’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0shU2g4IoI">Nest With Fedora keynote</a>, for example.
