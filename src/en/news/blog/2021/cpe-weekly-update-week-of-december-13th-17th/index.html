<p><strong>Note</strong>: We have canceled our Infrastructure meeting for Dec 23rd and Dec 30th to allow our team spend time offline during the holidays with family and friends. You would also notice a gap in updates and some task progress during this time.</p>



<h1>Highlights of the week</h1>



<h2>Infrastructure &amp; Release Engineering</h2>



<h3>Goal of this Initiative</h3>



<p>Purpose of this team is to take care of day to day business regarding CentOS and Fedora Infrastructure and Fedora release engineering work. It’s responsible for services running in Fedora and CentOS infrastructure and preparing things for the new Fedora release (mirrors, mass branching, new namespaces etc.). The ARC (which is a subset of the team) investigates possible initiatives that CPE might take on.</p>



<h2>Update</h2>



<h3>Fedora Infra</h3>



<ul>
<li>Log4j CVE affects our Openshift 3, mitigated via <a href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6578441">fix</a>
</li>
<li>Deployed an Openshift Dedicated cluster on AWS still deciding</li>
<li>Lots of spam cleared off mailing lists</li>
</ul>



<h3>CentOS Infra including CentOS CI</h3>



<ul>
<li>Various activities/preparation for CentOS Linux 8 EOL process<ul>
<li>Proposal for SIGs to <a href="https://lists.centos.org/pipermail/centos-devel/2021-December/098779.html">switch to RHEL8</a>
</li>
<li>Preparing needed steps to clear content and remove it from mirrorlist</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WIP for Meta group for SIGs, allowing to build+push their -release pkgs (not having to depend on CentOS Stream team for this)</li>
<li>Investigating <a href="https://pagure.io/centos-infra/issue/555">openshift template issue</a> for newer deployed projects and jenkins</li>
<li>Log4j CVE impact analysis (impacting OCP 4 if Elasticsearch is used, which we are not using)</li>
<li>Stream MVBE infra : renewal process for internal TLS cert</li>
</ul>



<h2>CentOS Stream</h2>



<h3>Goal of this Initiative</h3>



<p>This initiative is working on CentOS Stream/Emerging RHEL to make this new distribution a reality. The goal of this initiative is to prepare the ecosystem for the new CentOS Stream.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<ul>
<li>Dealing with a slowdown in rpm signing</li>
<li>Continuing the development Content Resolver enhancements</li>
<li>Various cleanup and docs work at various places</li>
</ul>



<h2>CentOS Duffy CI</h2>



<h3>Goal of this Initiative</h3>



<p>Duffy is a system within CentOS CI Infra which allows tenants to provision and access bare metal resources of multiple architectures for the purposes of CI testing. We need to add the ability to checkout VMs in CentOS CI in Duffy. We have OpenNebula hypervisor available, and have started developing playbooks which can be used to create VMs using the OpenNebula API, but due to the current state of how Duffy is deployed, we are blocked with new dev work to add the VM checkout functionality.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<ul>
<li>Foundation for background tasks in place</li>
<li>Started work on authentication and the session workflow</li>
<li>CLI polish</li>
</ul>



<h2>OSCI – Distrobaker monitoring</h2>



<h3>Goal of this Initiative</h3>



<p>This initiative is to improve the Distrobaker monitoring to monitor side-tags and module builds. Distrobaker is a service which rebuilds the CentOS 9 Stream Koji builds for RHEL 9 in Brew.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<ul><li>Added a barebones implementation of gathering side tag metrics</li></ul>



<h2>EPEL</h2>



<h3>Goal of this initiative</h3>



<p>Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (or EPEL) is a Fedora Special Interest Group that creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, including, but not limited to, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL), Oracle Linux (OL).</p>



<p>EPEL packages are usually based on their Fedora counterparts and will never conflict with or replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distributions. EPEL uses much of the same infrastructure as Fedora, including buildsystem, bugzilla instance, updates manager, mirror manager and more.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<ul><li>No updates – team on time offs</li></ul>
