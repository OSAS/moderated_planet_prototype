<p>The Community Platform Engineering (CPE) group is the Red Hat team combining IT and release engineering from Fedora and CentOS. Our goal is to keep core servers and services running and maintained, build releases, and other strategic tasks that need more dedicated time than volunteers can give. See our <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cpe/">docs</a> for more information.</p>



<p>We are hiring new talent to come work full time on Fedora and CentOS. The following positions are now open:</p>



<span id="more-9840"></span>



<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://global-redhat.icims.com/jobs/86240/software-engineer/job?hub=7">LATAM-based Associate / Engineer level</a>, perfect for someone new to the industry or someone early in their career. We are looking for an infrastructure focused hire.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://global-redhat.icims.com/jobs/86269/associate-software-engineer/job?hub=7">Associate / Engineer level in India</a>. This is more a software engineering / DevOps focused role, perfect for graduates or people early in their career.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://global-redhat.icims.com/jobs/86243/associate-manager-software-engineering---community-platform-engineering/job">EMEA-based Associate Manager</a>. We are looking for a people-focused Manager to join our team to help with the people management workload. This is perfect for aspiring managers looking to move into their first management role or for anybody early in their people management career.</li>
</ul>



<p>Please note that due to a constraint in how the jobs system works, a single country is nominated for the advertisement. Kindly ignore that, two of the roles are available in the geographical regions outlined above.</p>



<p>A source of the hiring is the internal mobility of three of our CPE members. Pierre-Yves Chibon (pingou), Stephen Smoogen (smooge), and Leonardo Rossetti have moved onto another project within Red Hat. While pingou and Leonardo are still within CPE, their efforts will not be geared towards Fedora going forward. We still hope to see them in and around the Fedora community, but it will not be in a full time capacity. For transparency, we wish to share this with the community.Â </p>



<p>We are looking forward to meeting you and hopefully working with you soon!</p>
