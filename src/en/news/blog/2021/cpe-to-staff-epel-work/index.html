<p>We are pleased to announce that Red Hat is establishing a small team directly responsible for participating in <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a> activities. Their job isnâ€™t to displace the EPEL community, but rather to support it full-time. We expect many beneficial effects, among those better EPEL readiness for a RHEL major release. The EPEL team will be part of the wider Community Platform Engineering group, or CPE for short.</p>



<p>As a reminder, CPE is the Red Hat team combining IT and release engineering from Fedora and CentOS.<br>Right now we are staffing up the team and expect to see us begin this work from October 2021. Keep an eye on the EPEL mailing <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/epel-devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/">list</a> and the associated <a href="https://pagure.io/epel/issues">tracker</a> as we begin this exciting journey with the EPEL community.</p>
