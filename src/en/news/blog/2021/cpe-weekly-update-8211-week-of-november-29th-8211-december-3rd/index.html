<p>This is a weekly report from the CPE (Community Platform Engineering)<br>Team. If you have any questions or feedback, please respond to this<br>report or contact us on #redhat-cpe channel on libera.chat<br>(https://libera.chat/).<br></p>



<h1>Highlights of the week</h1>



<h2>Infrastructure &amp; Release Engineering</h2>



<h2>Goal of this Initiative</h2>



<p>Purpose of this team is to take care of day to day business regarding<br>CentOS and Fedora Infrastructure and Fedora release engineering work.<br>It’s responsible for services running in Fedora and CentOS<br>infrastructure and preparing things for the new Fedora release<br>(mirrors, mass branching, new namespaces etc.). The ARC (which is a<br>subset of the team) investigates possible initiatives that CPE might<br>take on.</p>



<h2>Update</h2>

<li>Tested an <a href="https://pagure.io/centos-infra/issue/535">“image-build”</a> and we’ll document how SIGs will be able to build appliances/images through cbs</li>
<li>New TAGs (BAU)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sponsored infra: added <a href="https://github.com/CentOS/ansible-role-zabbix-agent/commit/be532e32758b2d5378a1effaff1223fe9cf8aab0">zabbix macros through ansible</a> to trigger alert on higher BW consumption</li>

</ul>



<h3>Release Engineering</h3>



<ul><li>Fedora 33 is EOL as of 30.11</li></ul>



<h2>CentOS Stream</h2>



<h2>Goal of this Initiative</h2>



<p>This initiative is working on CentOS Stream/Emerging RHEL to make this<br>new distribution a reality. The goal of this initiative is to prepare<br>the ecosystem for the new CentOS Stream.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<ul><li>ELN compose tracker is deployed</li></ul>



<h2>OSCI – Distrobaker monitoring</h2>



<h2>Goal of this Initiative</h2>



<p>This initiative is to improve the Distrobaker monitoring to monitor side-tags and module builds. Distrobaker is a service which rebuilds the CentOS 9 Stream Koji builds for RHEL 9 in Brew.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<ul><li>Just getting familiar with the codebase, starting to make minor changes and check outputs.</li></ul>



<h2>CentOS Duffy CI</h2>



<h2>Goal of this Initiative</h2>



<p>Duffy is a system within CentOS CI Infra which allows tenants to provision and<br>access bare metal resources of multiple architectures for the purposes of<br>CI testing.<br>We need to add the ability to checkout VMs in CentOS CI in Duffy. We have<br>OpenNebula hypervisor available, and have started developing playbooks which<br>can be used to create VMs using the OpenNebula API, but due to the current state<br>of how Duffy is deployed, we are blocked with new dev work to add the<br>VM checkout functionality.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<ul>
<li>API exposes database models (the gift that keeps on giving, almost done, any year now!)</li>
<li>Interfacing with OpenNebula to hand out virtual machines</li>
</ul>



<h2>EPEL</h2>



<h2>Goal of this initiative</h2>



<p>Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (or EPEL) is a Fedora Special Interest Group that creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional packages for Enterprise Linux, including, but not limited to, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL), Oracle Linux (OL).</p>



<p>EPEL packages are usually based on their Fedora counterparts and will never conflict with or replace packages in the base Enterprise Linux distributions. EPEL uses much of the same infrastructure as Fedora, including buildsystem, bugzilla instance, updates manager, mirror manager and more.</p>



<h2>Updates</h2>



<ul><li>EPEL Steering Committee <a href="https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/teams/epel/epel.2021-11-24-21.00.html">voted</a> to use <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/epel-devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/NH4CM6MAVUTUH35NDM53PTKCHODSEP6F/">plan C</a> for the EPEL 9 rollout. This means we will finish up EPEL 9 and announce EPEL 9 and EPEL 9 Next simultaneously.</li></ul>
