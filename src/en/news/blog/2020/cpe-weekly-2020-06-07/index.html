<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Community Platform Engineering group is the Red Hat team combining<br>
IT and release engineering from Fedora and CentOS. Our goal is to keep<br>
core servers and services running and maintained, build releases, and<br>
other strategic tasks that need more dedicated time than volunteers<br>
can give.</p>
<p>See our wiki page here for more<br>
information: <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cpe/">https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/cpe/</a></p>

*Note: Initiatives are large pieces of work that require a team of<br>
people and weeks/months to complete. Please continue to open tickets<br>
in the normal way for bugs, issues, etc.</p>

<p>CPE Product Owner Office Hours: Thursdays @ 1300 UTC on #fedora-meeting-1</p>
<h2>Fedora Updates</h2>
<h3>Data Centre Move</h3>
<p>* A reduced services offering of Fedora will begin tomorrow, June 8th<br>
until July 28th, est.<br>
* This is to complete the final shipment of hardware from Phoenix to<br>
Washington, so please be patient and understanding during this<br>
timeframe as some services will be off and the rest, much slower.<br>
* Please read the below email sent by kfenzi if you have not already<br>
done so: <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/infrastructure@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/E7HJULW2S76FZCAICURWXX223N5ZXXD7/">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/infrastructure@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/E7HJULW2S76FZCAICURWXX223N5ZXXD7/</a><br>
* Details on what this move may mean for you can be found here<br>
<a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/27U6YT73556KYW2RIFJO6J2HYMYVP22U/">https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/27U6YT73556KYW2RIFJO6J2HYMYVP22U/</a><br>
* If an application is not working correctly at all, please check this<br>
list <a href="https://hackmd.io/hpYYJQRjQy-oHxUS7IonIA?view">https://hackmd.io/hpYYJQRjQy-oHxUS7IonIA?view</a> before opening a<br>
ticket to make sure its not listed as being moved. If it is being<br>
moved, please wait a day or two, then try again.<br>
* Similarly, please be patient when opening tickets for service issues<br>
in general as we have now reached the critical point in this move and<br>
all of our sys-admins and wider teams will be assisting in the<br>
successful bringup of the reduced Fedora service and facilitation of<br>
the final hardware shipment and move.</p>
<h3>AAA Replacement</h3>
<p>* The team are working on implementing an aspect of the service that<br>
will allow users to select their applicable contributor agreement(s)<br>
as we are merging both Fedora and CentOS authentication system under<br>
the Noggin' solution.<br>
* The team have also added a blog pref to the feature set in Noggin<br>
* They have added pagination to the solution<br>
* And are working through redirecting applications to interface with the new API<br>
* Please feel free to check out the team kanban board for more<br>
information on the features the team are working on and have already<br>
completed here <a href="https://github.com/orgs/fedora-infra/projects/6">https://github.com/orgs/fedora-infra/projects/6</a></p>
<h3>Mbbox</h3>
<p>* Project Dashboard here <a href="https://github.com/fedora-infra/mbbox/projects/1">https://github.com/fedora-infra/mbbox/projects/1</a><br>
* Sprint 4 is underway with the following work being addressed:<br>
* Kojira CRD &amp; Documentation completed<br>
* MBS Backend CRD is almost done<br>
* And the team are now waiting on a staging environment to deploy<br>
and test in. We hope to have this in place by the end of this week</p>
<h3>Gitforge</h3>
<p>Good discussion on the CPE PO Office Hours meeting this Thursday, 4th<br>
June around the possibility of scheduling an AMA session/technical<br>
panel session with some folks from GitLab to allow the Fedora<br>
community a direct line to discuss services, potential blockers, etc.<br>
General feedback is that this will be welcome so I will work with<br>
GitLab and cverna, who is still leading the technical side of the<br>
project (link to ticket below) to plan the best time for this session<br>
&amp; work with you all to set an agenda/discussion points for the<br>
meeting. NOTE: Due to the data centre move, this session will not<br>
happen before late August or early September at a minimum. Thank you<br>
for your engagement with us on this!<br>

<h2>CentOS Updates</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>CentOS</h3>
<p>* CentOS Linux 8.2.2004 RC composes are with QA</p>
<h3>CentOS Stream</h3>
<p>* The team resolved all of the 8.2 build failures in CentOS Stream in<br>
their recent sprint (May 21st - June 5th)<br>
* An issue where a SIG was unable to push new content to<br>
git.centos.org was resolved, and is currently in staging<br>
* The team are also investigating how best to separate CentOS Linux<br>
branding from CentOS Stream<br>
* We are also focusing on building more packages in Stream for our<br>
current sprint (June 5th - 19th) and working on more automation and<br>
variance to help improve the current process and time it takes for our<br>
team to build packages</p>
<p>As always, feedback is welcome, and we will continue to look at ways<br>
to improve the delivery and readability of this weekly report.</p>
<p>Have a great week ahead!</p>
