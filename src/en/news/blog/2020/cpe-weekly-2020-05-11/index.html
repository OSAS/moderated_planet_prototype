* I have an Office hours IRC meeting slot on #fedora-meeting-1 @ 1300-1400 UTC every Thursday. Feel free to stop by and say hi! We can talk about Gitforge, or not <img src="//s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;">Â <em><strong>Note, this is an update to the meeting time from when this update was originally posted.</strong></em></p>
<h3>Data Centre Move</h3>
<p>* Communishift is unfortunately offline until mid to end of June. The guys hit some unfortunate roadblocks which cost us a lot of time and energy. As we are starting to bring up hardware in IAD2 for the reduced Fedora offering next week, the hard but necessary decision was taken to pause bringing up CommuniShift in RDU-CC for now and come back to this once theÂ  *slightly* more critical work is done or close to complete in IAD2.<br>
* Thank you for your patience, this is a colossal undertaking for the team and your support and understanding is very much appreciated.<br>
* Full amended schedule is here <a href="https://hackmd.io/vDwoayVLQ8yjyDk3PDvC8A?view">https://hackmd.io/vDwoayVLQ8yjyDk3PDvC8A?view</a><br>
* And updates are being posted here <a href="https://status.fedoraproject.org/">https://status.fedoraproject.org/</a><br>
* Again, as this project is currently being run by a two man team, we appreciate and thank you for your patience for delayed replies to tickets/requests/pings related to Fedora infra.</p>
